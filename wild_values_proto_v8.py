Are you concerned about the loss of nature and wildlife? Do you think society should be taking action to protect nature before it‚Äôs too late?    

If your answer to both of these questions is ‚Äúyes‚Äù then you‚Äôre one of many. Most people in the UK are concerned about the loss of nature and wildlife. Most of us agree that nature needs to be protected, but we have many different views about how and why we should go about doing this.
If we want the same outcomes for nature but have different views about how to achieve those outcomes, then it‚Äôs important that we try to understand our own views more completely. It‚Äôs surely even more important that we try to understand the views of others. There is no one way to protect nature, just like there is no one way to deliver public services, and no one way to organise society. 

When it comes to issues like organising society, we have long-established ways to measure and understand our views‚Äîlike whether we‚Äôre on the left or the right politically. The same cannot be said for of nature and its protection. Are there distinct ways of thinking about nature and how to protect it? Do these relate to different the different values we hold?
These are the questions we‚Äôre hoping you‚Äôll enjoy helping us answer.
